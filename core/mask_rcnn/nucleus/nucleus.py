       the command line as such:

    # Train a new model starting from ImageNet weights
    python3 nucleus.py train --dataset=/path/to/dataset --subset=train --weights=imagenet

    # Train a new model starting from specific weights file
    python3 nucleus.py train --dataset=/path/to/dataset --subset=train --weights=/path/to/weights.h5

    # Resume training a model that you had trained earlier
    python3 nucleus.py train --dataset=/path/to/dataset --subset=train --weights=last

    # Generate submission file
    python3 nucleus.py detect --dataset=/path/to/dataset --subset=train --weights=<last or /path/to/weights.h5>
